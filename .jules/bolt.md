## 2024-05-18 - Avoiding O(N²) List Concatenation in Python with `reduce`
**Learning:** Using `reduce` with a lambda like `lambda acc, item: acc + item` on lists creates a new list object on every iteration, leading to O(N²) time complexity for N items. This pattern in `sort_numerically` caused noticeable slowdowns when sorting thousands of tags.
**Action:** Replace `reduce(lambda acc, item: acc + item, lists, [])` with a direct `for` loop using `list.extend()` or `list.append()`, which modifies the list in place and gives O(N) complexity. Always check `reduce` usages in Python for hidden performance traps with mutable collections.

## 2024-07-24 - Avoiding `reduce` with list concatenation for list flattening
**Learning:** Continuing on the previous learning, I found multiple instances in this codebase (`semantic-release`) where `reduce` is used to flatten lists (e.g. `reduce(lambda all_msgs, msgs: all_msgs + msgs, map(...), [])` or `reduce(lambda acc, p_results: [*acc, ...], ...)`). This results in O(N^2) time complexity and memory allocations because it creates a new list copy on every iteration.
**Action:** Replace these usages of `reduce` with O(N) alternatives such as list comprehensions (e.g., `[item for sublist in lists for item in sublist]`) or `itertools.chain.from_iterable` to significantly improve performance when handling larger numbers of commits.

## 2024-05-23 - Avoid eager evaluation with all() and any()
**Learning:** Using `all([...])` or `any([...])` with explicit lists (or list comprehensions) defeats lazy evaluation. The Python interpreter constructs the entire list in memory before passing it to `all()` or `any()`. This creates O(N) memory allocations and prevents short-circuiting.
**Action:** Replace `all([A, B])` with explicit `A and B`. For collections, use generator expressions `all(x for x in data)` instead of list comprehensions `all([x for x in data])` to ensure lazy evaluation and boolean short-circuiting.
