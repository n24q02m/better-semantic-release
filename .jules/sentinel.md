## 2026-09-07 - [action.sh SSH Key Handling]
**Vulnerability:** The GitHub Action shell script writes the SSH public key and allowed signers using `echo` and redirect operators, but the `.ssh` directory and `allowed_signers` file are created without explicit strict permissions.
**Learning:** TOCTOU risks and lack of explicit permissions on `.ssh` creation expose keys to concurrent processes or untrusted local processes within CI runners.
**Prevention:** Apply `chmod 700 ~/.ssh` after creation, and utilize `printf` instead of `echo` to prevent unintended processing of flags by different shell environments.
