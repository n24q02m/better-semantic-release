## 2026-09-07 - [action.sh SSH Key Handling]
**Vulnerability:** The GitHub Action shell script writes the SSH public key and allowed signers using `echo` and redirect operators, but the `.ssh` directory and `allowed_signers` file are created without explicit strict permissions.
**Learning:** TOCTOU risks and lack of explicit permissions on `.ssh` creation expose keys to concurrent processes or untrusted local processes within CI runners.
**Prevention:** Apply `chmod 700 ~/.ssh` after creation, and utilize `printf` instead of `echo` to prevent unintended processing of flags by different shell environments.

## 2026-09-07 - [action.sh Private Key Hash Leak]
**Vulnerability:** Outputting the SHA256 hash of the SSH private key (`sha256sum ~/.ssh/signing_key`) in a shell script leaks credential derivatives and fingerprinting metadata to standard output.
**Learning:** Even if the plaintext key is protected (e.g. avoiding `cat`), emitting cryptographic hashes of secrets into CI/CD build logs exposes fingerprinting data that could be leveraged by attackers.
**Prevention:** Never compute and print hashes of secrets or sensitive files in CI/CD pipeline scripts.

## 2026-09-07 - [action.sh SSH Metadata Leak]
**Vulnerability:** Calling `ssh-agent` and `ssh-add` without redirecting output leaks metadata (such as agent PIDs and key fingerprints) into the CI build logs.
**Learning:** Native secret-handling commands emit sensitive tracking data to standard output by default, leading to metadata exposure.
**Prevention:** Always redirect standard output and standard error for `ssh-agent` (evaluated) and `ssh-add` commands to `/dev/null` in CI/CD pipelines.
